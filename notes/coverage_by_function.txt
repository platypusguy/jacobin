To see code coverage percentages by file instead of by directory in go test -cover, you need to use
the -covermode=count flag and then process the output of the -coverprofile flag with the
go tool cover command.

Here's the two-step process:

Step 1: Generate a Code Coverage Profile
========================================

First, run your tests and generate a coverage profile file. The -coverprofile flag tells the go test command to
write the coverage data to a file.

go test -covermode=count -coverprofile=cov_profile.out ./...
    • go test: The command to run tests.
    • -covermode=count: This is a key flag. It tracks the number of times each statement is executed, which is
      necessary for a detailed report.
    • -coverprofile=cov_profile.out: This flag creates a file named cov_profile.out with the coverage data. You can
       name this file anything you want.
    • ./...: This pattern tells the command to run tests for all packages in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Step 2: Display the Per-File Report
===================================

Next, use the go tool cover command with the profile file you just created. The -func flag specifies that you
want a function-level report, which includes the coverage for each file.

go tool cover -func=cov_profile.out 2>&1 | tee cov_per_function.out

This command will produce a table that lists each Go source file, the number of functions in it, and the
percentage of those functions that were covered by tests. The output will look something like this:
github.com/your/package/path/file1.go:    FunctionName1    90.0%
github.com/your/package/path/file2.go:    FunctionName2    75.5%
...
total:                (statements)    85.2%

Other approaches

Detailed HTML report
--------------------
A per-file, per-line HTML report is also available using:

go test ./... -coverprofile=cov_profile.out -covermode=count
go tool cover -html=cov_profile.out

Using Goland's tools
--------------------
Using Goland's built-in code coverage tools:

* at the run configuration, hit the 3 dots and choose to run with coverage
* on Windows, Ctl-Alt-F6 shows the coverage in the file gutter on a per-line basis and in the project window on a
  per-file basis
